DESCRIPTION= Hi, I am Deepjyoti Barman, a Python developer (fresher) actively seeking opportunities in your esteemed company. If my skills align with your requirements, I would be delighted to connect. I began my journey in 2021 as a bug bounty hunter with HackerOne, a U.S.-based platform. My role involved identifying vulnerabilities in client websites, preparing detailed documentation of the issues, and presenting proof of concept to the technical team. After gaining valuable experience, I took a 2-year break to prepare for government exams. Now, I am eager to restart my career and contribute my skills effectively. I am 24 years old, based in Guwahati, and hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from Cotton University. My technical expertise includes Python, Flask, FastAPI, and Django. I completed my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya Maligaon. I am enthusiastic about bringing my dedication and skills to your team!
